# EM-RETRO - A Retro Microprocessor Emulator

EM-RETRO is a emulator for 8 early microprocessors based on a modern 16-bit
micro-controller. Currently the emulations for the SC/MP, CDP 1802, 6800,
6502, 65C02 and 8080 are complete and working. The code for the Z80 and 6809
is not yet fully functional.

All you need to play with EM-RETRO is a PIC24EP512GP202 micro-controller, three
capacitors (2x 100nF and a 10uF tantalum), a 10K resistor, a USB serial adapter
and a PICKit 3 programmer.
